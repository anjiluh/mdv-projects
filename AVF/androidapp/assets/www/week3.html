        	Most resources weren’t available for this year. The most up to date information is listed above from the iTunes store statistics (iTunes).

        	<h3>Based on your three answers above, what might you infer about each of the markets listed?
        	</h3>
        	<h2>
	        	To be honest, these statistics vary on a week to week basis. I’d say that it just says something specific about the week. This week these companies are buying games.        
        	</h2>
        	<h3>
        	What is the average cost and bandwidth limits per user (in general) in each of the three markets?
        	</h3>
        	<h2>US - $3.33 for 1mbps, bandwidth is 4.8mbps</h2>
        	<h2>Great Britain- $10-$20 per month for 1mbps, average is 3mbps</h2>
        	<h2>Japan- $0.27 for 1mbps, bandwidth is 61mbps(visual.ly).</h2>
        	<h3>How may this impact development?</h3>
        	<h2>	Japan has the fastest availability with the cheapest network. Sounds like we should all move to Japan to build up our applications. It impacts development because they’re networks are faster. They’ll be able to output more applications that are faster. 
        	</h2>
        	<h3>And, finally, what would be your suggested strategy in project topic and global market choice? Feel free to have a first and second choice.</h3>
        	<h2>
	Gain a faster network or move to japan and work on applications there. As well as become game developers because those sell the best in majority of markets around the world.
