        	</h3>
        	<h2>Title all of the anchor tags and use well known semantic html tags such as 					heading, anchor, and list. This way if a disabled or deaf person was 						maneuvering the mouse across the page, they would be able to hear what 						buttons did which.

        	<h3>Visit a video service on the web (like YouTube) and search for "Screen Reader 				Demo" and "Mobile Screen Reader" - what are some of the common frustrations 				(or common support mechanisms) that you see among the examples that are given 				- how could you fix them (or use them)?
        	</h3>

        	</h3>
        	<h2>There are a lot of android devices that are specific to support 							accessibility. The most popular on youtube is the HTC Dream, as it is used in 				many videos on youtube.
        	</h2>
        	<h3>Mobile Apps: Please list two apps (either Android or iOS, or both) that are 				made specifically to support Accessibility.
        	</h3>
