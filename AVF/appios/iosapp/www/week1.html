        <h3>1.	Less obvious perks of using 'live' data resources include logins and payments. How could 				Twitter be used in these two scenarios?
	    </h3>
        <h2>
	        Twitter could be used to login via twitter and the app could use their payment info to link with 			twitter. Instead of writing personal info, they could use the info already created on their twitter page.
        </h2>
        <h3>
2.	Visit Programmableweb.com and search for JSON-P data sources. Why would we need JSON-P, specifically?
		</h3>
		<h2>
I would need JSON-P specifically for event information for our church events; it would have the login info for the children and an attendance record. That’s where it could be found. It specifically allows developers to load data directly on the client side no matter the originating server.
		</h2>
		<h3>
3.	Based on the JSON-P search results: what data resource(s) do you think might pair well with which types of Native device features?
		</h3>
		<h2>
All of the twitter responses could be used to add to twitter. Who doesn’t want to advertise from twitter from your device. Apple did this, you can tweet from just the drop down menu, its now become a native device feature. This could also pair well with that.
		</h2>
		<h3>
4.	Please describe any design and functionality intentions you may have for your Demo app components this month.	</h3>
		<h2>
My original app is for my church. I chose events because I want them to be able to see their events from the app. I chose camera because if they’d like to add photos and take photos from the app. I’d want Notification to let them know about any upcoming events or reminders about anything. I chose Storage because it’s a Check-in app, anyone who attends the church fills out a “I’m here” card. Its not really for attendance but its mostly for contact info so we can send them things as soon as they leave to remind them about coming back and hanging out with us. Storage would hold all of this information. Lastly I chose Globalization so that anything would happen in our time zone and would be done with our currency. 
I chose twitter, to be able to follow the pastors or attendars tweets. A place where it would be a tweet field specific to our members. And Facebook to view the facebook page. Members would be able to post their prayer requests straight to the page and see others requests so they could instantly pray if they saw one. 
		</h2>
		<h3>
5.	Briefly describe some past 'lessons learned' regarding workflow as it relates to research, design, development, etc.
		</h3>
		<h2>
As for workflow, its best to keep things organized. Research design as it changes on a daily basis and keep researching development as things are always changing. Methods are always updating and its important to keep up to date on these things.
